# Smart Energy #

The purpose of this project is to provide a software and hardware-based solution to measure the energy
consumption of devices.

The project will consist of the following components:

* Backend Server and Rest API
* Frontend Client with responsive UI (WIP)
* Desktop and Mobile client application (TODO)
* Hardware-based smart plugs (TODO)

Any help and contribution is appreciated.
